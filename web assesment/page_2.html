        <h2>Just to reiterate..</h2>
    <p> Assembing your board: </p>
   
      <div class="list">
        <ol>
   <li>The Board<br>
   Although any kind of flat surface will do, having a slate or wooden tray is preferred. Though there is no need to rush and find one, a piece of parchement paper will do just fine.
   </li> 
   <li>
   Starting with the cheeses<br>
   using a variety of differnt textures and flavours will work in your favour. This is something I will continue to talk about on my second page. 
   </li>
   <li>Going in with the meats<br>
   Using a range from cured, to fresh meats will also work in your favour. This is another thing I will extend upon.</li>
   <li>Bringing in some savoury<br>
   Adding things like olives, pickles, etc will add another layer of depth to the board, entising even more people than before.   
   </li>
   <li>Adding some sweet<br>
    Depending on your aesthetic, you may drift more towards fresh fruit than dried fruit, or vice versa. Add some honey, or even chocolate!
    </li> 
    <li>Lastly, some flair<br>
    Think edible flowers, herbs, and more fruit. I used pomegranate seeds in mine. 
    </li>
   </ol> 
   </div>  
        
        <h2>Picking your ingredients</h2>
   <p>Like I said on the previous page, having acess to your ingredients is the most important part of your board. Take out the time to find your ingredients. Drive around, or get your parents to drive you around and condisider your options. The key is two have different textures and flavours, food is a sensory experince. You want the board to smell good, look good and most importanly, taste good. Everyone likes their cheese differently, by introducing different flavours and textures you'll be able to cater to most. So below I have listed ingredient ideas for your board.

        <h2>Presenting and serving your board</h2>
    <P>Once your board is assembled, you want to cover it and leave it in the fridge, removing beforehand to allow the cheese to come to room temperatue. Cheese is best when seved at room temperature. I personally prefer my olives and pickles served cold, so I would place those in their respective places before serving. The same goes to chocolate, melted chocolate will make a mess of the board so be wary of it. when serving your cheese, slice or crumble a bit of it so it looks ready to eat. Keep flavours that go together close to each other, this makes it easier for people to dig in. </P>
